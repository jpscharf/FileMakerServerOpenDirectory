### Authentication Order ###

**The order matters, if a user has a FileMaker account and an OpenDirectory account, using the same username, the first account/group that accepts the provided username and password will be the one used.**

* Legacy local user "localUser" &#9312; [Full Access]
* New OD Group "ODUserGroup" &#9313; [Edit Only]
* "localUser" logs in with his old local password and is given [Full Access] even though he is in the group "ODUserGroup" and was expected to have [Edit Only] access.
